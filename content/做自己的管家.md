Discipline is essential to every success in life. It establishes the stable, well-ordered ground that allows an individual to set and achieve goals. It prevents the ensnaring, vice-filled traps that torpedo advancement. It creates the consistent habits that forward progress. And it develops the authority that influences others.   

纪律对于生活中的每一个成功都是必不可少的。它建立了稳定、有序的基础，使个人能够设定和实现目标。它可以防止陷阱，充满恶习的陷阱，破坏鱼雷前进。它创造了推动进步的一致习惯。它发展了影响他人的权威。

As behavioral analyst [Chase Hughes shared on the podcast](https://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/authority-is-more-important-than-social-skills-in-being-influential/), when an individual not only puts on a good face in public, but is truly disciplined in their private life, they project confidence and competence. Whether or not you’re disciplined when the metaphorical cameras are off is something you can’t help but exude and that others instinctively pick up on. People intuitively trust and follow individuals who embody discipline and reflexively take a step back from those who don’t.  

正如行为分析师蔡斯·休斯（Chase Hughes）在播客上分享的那样，当一个人不仅在公共场合摆出一副好脸，而且在私生活中真正自律时，他们就会表现出自信和能力。当隐喻相机关闭时，你是否受到纪律约束是你情不自禁的，其他人会本能地接受。人们本能地信任并跟随那些体现纪律的人，并反射性地从那些没有纪律的人那里退后一步。

Chase defines discipline “as the ability to prioritize the needs of your future self ahead of your own.”  

蔡斯将纪律定义为“将未来自我的需求置于自己的需求之上的能力”。

If you’re a college student, and you stay up all night drinking even though you have exams the next day, that’s a failure on the discipline front. As Chase observes, you’ll wake up the next morning thinking, “‘I can’t believe I did that.’ And \[you’ll be\] mad at your past tense self because you didn’t have concern for your future self.”  

如果你是一名大学生，即使第二天有考试，你也会熬夜喝酒，这在纪律方面是失败的。正如蔡斯所观察到的，第二天早上醒来时你会想，“'我简直不敢相信我做到了。\[你会\]对你过去的时态自我生气，因为你不关心未来的自己。

If, on the other hand, you spend the night studying and hit the hay early so you’re well-rested for exams the next day, you’re taking care of your future self, and leveling up in your discipline.  

另一方面，如果你整晚学习，早早地打干草，以便第二天的考试休息好，那么你就是在照顾未来的自己，并在你的纪律上升级。

As an encouragement to prioritize your long-term aims over your short-term desires, Chase advises thinking of yourself as your own butler.  

为了鼓励你优先考虑你的长期目标而不是短期愿望，蔡斯建议将自己视为自己的管家。

While few people can afford a full-time, live-in manservant, your present self can act as a butler to your future self.   

虽然很少有人能负担得起全职的住家男仆，但你现在的自己可以充当你未来自我的管家。

When, in the evening, you do things like pack what you need in your backpack or briefcase and set out your clothes for the next day, you serve as a butler to your future self, who, the next morning, will really appreciate the fact that his past tense self set up his present tense self for success.   

晚上，当你做一些事情，比如把你需要的东西装在背包或公文包里，为第二天准备衣服时，你就像你未来的自己的管家一样，第二天早上，他会真正体会到这样一个事实，即他过去时态的自我为成功奠定了现在时态的自我。

Chase described how this works regarding his own evening routine:  

蔡斯描述了他自己的晚间例行公事是如何运作的：

> I’m about to go to bed, and I’ll be sticking one of those little Keurig coffee cup pods into the coffee maker and sticking a coffee mug there, ready for the next morning. And out loud, I’ll say, ‘Man, Chase is gonna love this.’ So I will continuously speak about my future self in a way that I am prioritizing his needs, and I will talk about him in the future.  
> 
> 我马上就要上床睡觉了，我会把一个小小的Keurig咖啡杯荚塞进咖啡机里，然后把一个咖啡杯贴在那里，准备第二天早上。我会大声说，'伙计，蔡斯会喜欢这个的。所以我会不断地谈论我未来的自己，以一种优先考虑他的需求的方式，我将在未来谈论他。

When you develop a relationship between your present self and your future self, where the former serves the latter, you arrive at a point, Chase says, “where you’re looking forward in time with concern and . . . looking backward in time . . . with gratitude.” You develop a more holistic, integrated character.  

当你在现在的自我和未来的自我之间建立一种关系时，前者为后者服务，你就会到达一个点，蔡斯说，“你带着关切和......时光倒流 . . .怀着感激之情。你发展出一个更全面、更完整的性格。

By prioritizing the needs of your future self by becoming your own butler, you build the discipline that allows you to act, lead, and move forward in the way you desire; you build the discipline that grants you greater freedom, which, at the end of the day, is the ultimate luxury!  

通过成为自己的管家来优先考虑未来自我的需求，您可以建立纪律，使您能够以自己想要的方式行事、领导和前进;你建立了赋予你更大自由的纪律，归根结底，这是终极的奢侈！
