One of my rituals at the end of the year is asking myself these forty questions. I have made them available as [a Markdown file](https://github.com/kepano/40-questions) which has been [translated in several languages](https://github.com/kepano/40-questions/tree/master/translations).  

我在年末的仪式之一就是问自己这四十个问题。我已将它们制作成 Markdown 文件，并翻译成多种语言。

It usually takes me about a week to work my way through all of them. I find it to be one of the most valuable exercises to reflect on what happened, good and bad, and how I hope the year ahead will shape up.  

我通常需要一周的时间来完成所有的问题。我发现这是最有价值的练习之一，可以让我反思发生了什么，好的和坏的，以及我希望来年如何发展。

What is more interesting than each individual answer are the trends that emerge after years of answering the same questions. I’ve shared this list with my family and closest friends, and always enjoy discussing answers as we reflect on the year.  

比每个人的回答更有趣的是，在多年回答同样的问题之后，我们会发现一些趋势。我与家人和最亲密的朋友分享过这份清单，在反思这一年时，我们总是乐于讨论答案。

Feel free to add or remove questions, and [share your edits with me](https://www.twitter.com/kepano). This is first and foremost a personal exercise, so make it a tradition you can enjoy for years to come. See also my [40 questions to ask yourself every decade](https://stephango.com/40-questions-decade).  

欢迎添加或删除问题，并与我分享您的修改意见。这首先是一项个人练习，因此请将其作为一项传统，在今后的岁月里享受其中。另请参阅我的 "每十年问自己的 40 个问题"。
