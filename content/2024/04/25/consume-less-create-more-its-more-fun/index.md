Big corporations use marketing to trick us into thinking that the solution to all our problems lies in buying more of their stuff. 
大公司利用营销手段欺骗我们，让我们以为只要多买他们的东西，就能解决所有问题。

The real solution is often the exact opposite: it consists in consuming less, not more. In most cases, our problems are caused by overconsumption in the first place.   
真正的解决办法往往恰恰相反：那就是减少消费，而不是增加消费。在大多数情况下，我们的问题首先是由过度消费造成的。

For example, if you are overweight, you will be bombarded with ads for gym subscriptions or food supplements. But the key to losing weight is eating less – not new shoes and protein powder.   
例如，如果你超重，你就会被健身房订阅或食品补充剂的广告轰炸。但减肥的关键是少吃，而不是新鞋和蛋白粉。

Or, if you struggle with headaches and stress, they will try to sell you headache pills and antidepressants. But to really decrease stress, you should start sleeping and walking more instead of consuming entertainment products and browsing social media late at night. Pills are never designed to be a permanent solution: they lose power over time and cause side effects that will in turn require more pills. Once you embark on the endless journey of consumption, you get stuck in a trap designed to make you miserable and corporations happy. 
或者，如果你有头痛和压力，他们会试图向你推销头痛药和抗抑郁药。但要真正减轻压力，你应该开始多睡觉、多走路，而不是在深夜消费娱乐产品和浏览社交媒体。药片从来不是一劳永逸的解决方案：随着时间的推移，它们会失去药效，产生副作用，反过来又需要更多的药片。一旦你开始了无休止的消费之旅，你就会陷入一个让你痛苦、让企业快乐的陷阱。

Through evolution, Mother Nature has equipped us to efficiently cope with deficits of resources, but it never prepared us for life in the relative abundance we have now. Today, more people die from obesity than from hunger, and more people suffer from anxiety caused by information overload than from lack of news.  
通过进化，大自然赋予了我们高效应对资源短缺的能力，但却从未让我们为现在相对富足的生活做好准备。今天，死于肥胖的人数多于死于饥饿的人数，因信息过载而焦虑的人数多于因缺乏新闻而焦虑的人数。

Human DNA, our hardware, is obsolete. It stopped evolving about 10,000-20,000 years ago when we still lived in small hunter-gatherer communities. Back then, every sweet bite and every piece of information was extremely valuable. We now live in megacities, surrounded by tons of cheap sugar, but our DNA doesn’t know that. Our bodies still accumulate excess fat to prepare for harsh hungry winters that never come. Our minds cling to every disturbing piece of news telling us about threats that never materialize. 
人类的 DNA，我们的硬件，已经过时了。大约在 1 万至 2 万年前，当我们还生活在狩猎采集的小群体中时，它就停止了进化。那时，每一口甜食和每一条信息都极其珍贵。我们现在生活在大城市里，周围充斥着大量廉价的糖，但我们的 DNA 却不知道这一点。我们的身体仍在积聚多余的脂肪，为从未到来的饥饿严冬做准备。我们的大脑紧紧抓住每一条令人不安的新闻，告诉我们从未出现过的威胁。

This biological paradox is made worse by our economic system which emphasises GDP growth and maximized corporate profits. People are encouraged to increase consumption by both governments and corporations. It’s not a coincidence that the US, a country that excelled in economic growth in the 20th century, is also the most obese developed country in the world. Their market-driven society became too efficient for its own good. 
我们的经济体系强调国内生产总值的增长和企业利润的最大化，使这种生物悖论变得更加严重。政府和企业都鼓励人们增加消费。美国是 20 世纪经济增长最突出的国家，同时也是世界上最肥胖的发达国家，这并非巧合。他们以市场为导向的社会变得太有效率了。

Not only is this system harmful to humans, it is also unsustainable in the long-term. Unlike corporate appetites, our planet's resources are finite. We became very efficient in making and selling ourselves stuff we don’t need, but it is the planet which pays the bill. Our bodies still expect us to be living in the pristine environment we had 10,000-20,000 years ago, full of green forests and clean lakes. As we keep destroying our own habitat in the eternal quest for economic growth, the number of diseases caused by pollution continues to rise.  
这种制度不仅对人类有害，从长远来看也是不可持续的。与企业的胃口不同，我们星球的资源是有限的。我们在制造和销售自己不需要的东西方面变得非常有效率，但买单的却是地球。我们的身体仍然希望我们生活在 1 万至 2 万年前的原始环境中，那里充满了绿色的森林和干净的湖泊。由于我们在永恒的经济增长追求中不断破坏自己的生存环境，污染导致的疾病数量持续上升。

I was lucky to become wealthy early in my life. By the time I was 22, I had a million dollars in my bank account, by 25 – tens of millions, by 28 – hundreds of millions. However, this has never been what made me happy.  
我很幸运，很早就变得富有。22 岁时，我的银行账户里就有了一百万美元，25 岁时有了数千万美元，28 岁时有了数亿美元。然而，这从未让我感到快乐。

My real luck was in realizing pretty early that the most rewarding kind of occupation is creating things, not consuming them. So instead of buying yachts, airplanes and expensive real estate, I focused on what I enjoyed most – creating social platforms that (hopefully) bring good to humanity. I spent most of my personal funds on Telegram for people to enjoy a free service that strives for perfection.  
我真正的幸运在于很早就意识到，最有价值的职业是创造，而不是消费。因此，我没有购买游艇、飞机和昂贵的房产，而是专注于我最喜欢的事情--创建社交平台，（希望）能为人类带来福祉。我把大部分个人资金都花在了 Telegram 上，让人们享受到力求完美的免费服务。

I consider the ability to create things for others the most valuable – and rewarding – asset of mine. I suspect one of the reasons I happened to get wealthy in the process of doing what I love is because money has never been an important goal for me.  
我认为，为他人创造事物的能力是我最宝贵、最有价值的资产。我想，我之所以能在做自己喜欢的事情的过程中致富，其中一个原因就是金钱对我来说从来都不是一个重要的目标。

When I was a student, I liked building games and websites. Back then, it was considered an occupation for nerds. Promising students were expected to practice law or solve business cases. But I never really cared about how other people defined success. For me, success was in the ability to spend time creating things that I liked. 
学生时代，我喜欢制作游戏和网站。那时，这被认为是书呆子的职业。有前途的学生则被期望从事法律工作或解决商业案例。但我从不关心别人如何定义成功。对我来说，成功就是能够花时间创造自己喜欢的东西。

I never regret not buying expensive stuff wealthy people like to surround themselves with. The only regret I have is not having more time to build things.  
我从不后悔没有购买富人喜欢的昂贵物品。我唯一的遗憾就是没有更多的时间来建造东西。

We live in an era when the possibilities for human creativity are endless. One can invent robots, edit genes, design virtual worlds… There are so many exciting unknown areas to explore. I hope that more people will discover the enjoyment of building things for others. I hope that one day we, as a species, will turn away from the self-destructive path of never-ending consumption to a fulfilling journey of creating a better world for ourselves and those around us. 
我们生活在一个人类创造力无限可能的时代。我们可以发明机器人、编辑基因、设计虚拟世界......有太多令人兴奋的未知领域等待我们去探索。我希望有更多的人能够发现为他人制造物品的乐趣。我希望有一天，我们作为一个物种，能够从无休止消费的自我毁灭之路转向为我们自己和我们周围的人创造一个更美好世界的充实旅程。
