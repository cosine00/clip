# What’s Your Minimum Effective Dose?  
您的最小有效剂量是多少？

You’ve no-doubt heard of the Law of the Vital Few. It’s [the 80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), which states that roughly 80-percent of the results come about from just 20-percent of the energy.  
毫无疑问，你一定听说过 "关键少数法则"。这就是 80/20 法则，即大约 80% 的成果来自于 20% 的精力。

What if you took your 80-percent results and applied the 80/20 rule to them? And then one more time?  
如果您将 80% 的结果应用 80/20 法则呢？然后再来一次？

What you end up with is the idea that your initial 1-percent of energy spent brings about the first 50-percent of results.  
最终的结果是，你最初花费的 1% 的精力带来了最初 50% 的成果。

That 1-percent of energy spent reaps a dispraportionate result. Tim Ferris calls it the **Minimum Effective Dose**.  
这 1% 的能量消耗所收获的结果是不成正比的。蒂姆 - 费里斯称之为 "最小有效剂量"。

In his book, [_The One Thing_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1885167776/ref=nosim&tag=shabla-20), Gary Keller writes that “success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.”  
加里 - 凯勒在《唯一的事》一书中写道："成功是做正确的事，而不是做正确的一切"。

If there was one thing you could do that represented roughly 1-percent of your time and energy. And if that one thing was a cause for the intial half of the results you’re seeking. Then it’s safe to say that it’s a good idea to keep on doing that one thing.  
如果你能做一件事，而这件事只占你时间和精力的 1%。而且，如果这一件事是你所追求的结果的最初一半的原因。那么可以肯定地说，继续做这一件事是个好主意。

Step back for a moment and take stock of one area of your life that you want to improve. Perhaps it’s your health, your inner personal life, your relationship with your spouse or kids, your job, your finances, or your free time.  
退后一步，总结一下你生活中想要改善的一个方面。也许是你的健康，也许是你的内心世界，也许是你与配偶或孩子的关系，也许是你的工作，也许是你的财务，也许是你的空闲时间。

Looking at that area, you probably see right away the 1,000 things you wish were different and that you know you should change. But when you’re staring 1,000 important things in the face, you’ve no idea which one to start with. It’s totally overwhelming.  
看着这块区域，你可能会立刻看到 1000 件你希望与众不同的事情，而且你知道自己应该改变。但是，当你面对 1000 件重要的事情时，你却不知道该从哪一件开始。这完全让人不知所措。

Which is why you need that Minimum Effective Dose.  
这就是为什么你需要最低有效剂量。

Think again about that area of your life where you’d love to see change. What is **one thing** you could do that would have a disproportionate result compared to anything else you did?  
再想想你生活中最希望看到改变的地方。与你所做的其他事情相比，你能做的哪一件事会产生不成比例的效果？

*   Want to get in shape? Try walking for [15 minutes](https://shawnblanc.net/2019/04/three-things-that-have-helped-with-daily-workouts/) per day.  
    想要塑身？试试每天步行 15 分钟。
*   Want to improve your marriage? Compliment your spouse every day.  
    想改善您的婚姻吗？每天赞美你的配偶。
*   Want to get out of debt? Focus on paying off your smallest debt first to get it out of the way.  
    想要摆脱债务？先集中精力还清你最小的债务，让它不再成为你的负担。
*   Want to feel more recharged after the weekend? Read a book for 30 minutes before binge watching Netflix.  
    想在周末后感觉精力充沛吗？在狂看 Netflix 之前，先读 30 分钟书。
*   Want to advance your career? Find someone new to have lunch with every week and ask them what you can do to help them.  
    想要提升自己的职业生涯？每周找一位新同事共进午餐，并询问他们你能为他们做些什么。

These things in and of themselves will not revolutionize your life over night. But the power is in their simplicity and their _do-ability_. And once these things get into place as part of your day-to-day lifestyle then they create a momentum that you can ride as you incorporate new activities. For example, you start out just walkling for 30 minutes. And then you begin to jog for a while at first and then walk the rest of the way. Until pretty soon you’re jogging the full half-hour, and more…  
这些事情本身不会在一夜之间彻底改变你的生活。但它们的力量就在于简单易行。一旦这些事情成为你日常生活习惯的一部分，它们就会产生一种动力，让你在融入新的活动时能够顺势而为。例如，一开始你只是散步 30 分钟。然后，你开始慢跑一段时间，然后再步行。很快，你就能慢跑整整半个小时，甚至更多......

But that’s not all. The other advantage to defining a Minimum Effective Dose is the simplification it brings.  
但这还不是全部。定义最小有效剂量的另一个好处是简化了操作。

**Knowing the single most important thing you can do is liberating.  
知道自己能做的最重要的一件事，就等于解放了自己。**

It simplifies your life because you know what it is you need to do, every day. Which, in turn, helps you know what you _don’t_ need to do. You have just one task, one activity, one way to spend your energy. Go do it. Because [the value in small things done consistently over time](https://shawnblanc.net/2015/08/building-better-defaults/) cannot be underestimated.  
它简化了你的生活，因为你知道每天需要做什么。反过来，这也有助于你知道自己不需要做什么。你只有一项任务、一项活动、一种花费精力的方式。去做吧。因为长期坚持做小事的价值不可低估。
