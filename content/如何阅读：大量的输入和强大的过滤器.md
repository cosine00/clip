## How to Read: Lots of Inputs and a Strong Filter  

如何阅读：大量的输入和强大的过滤器



My reading strategy is to start as many books as I can but finish few of them.  

我的阅读策略是尽可能多地开始读书，但读完很少的书。

Years ago I heard Charlie Munger say “Most books I don’t read past the first chapter. I’m not burdened by bad books,” and it stuck with me.  

几年前，我听查理·芒格说：“大多数书我读不到第一章。我没有被糟糕的书所累，“它一直困扰着我。

Reading is a chore if you insist on finishing every book you begin, because the majority of books are either a) adequately summarized in the introduction, b) not for you, or c) not for anyone.  

如果你坚持读完你开始的每一本书，阅读是一件苦差事，因为大多数书要么a）在引言中充分总结，b）不适合你，要么c）不适合任何人。

Slogging through to the last page of these books – a habit likely formed early in school – can turn reading into the equivalent of a 10-hour work meeting where nothing gets done and everyone is bored. And once you see reading through that lens, your willingness to pick up another book wanes.  

读到这些书的最后一页——这可能是在学校早期养成的习惯——可以将阅读变成相当于10小时的工作会议，什么都没做，每个人都很无聊。一旦你通过这个镜头看待阅读，你拿起另一本书的意愿就会减弱。

Which, of course, is tragic. “The man who doesn’t read good books has no advantage over the man who can’t read them,” said Mark Twain.  

这当然是悲惨的。“不读好书的人比看不懂好书的人没有优势，”马克吐温说。

Every smart person I know is a voracious reader who also says “every smart person I know is a voracious reader.” There are so few exceptions to this rule it’s astounding. College tuition at $25,000 a year comes out to roughly $100 per lecture. Good books – sometimes written by the same professor – can be purchased for fifteen bucks and can offer multiple times as much life-changing insight.  

我认识的每个聪明人都是贪婪的读者，他也说“我认识的每个聪明人都是贪婪的读者”。这条规则的例外如此之少，令人震惊。每年 25,000 美元的大学学费约为每堂课 100 美元。好书——有时由同一位教授写的——可以花十五美元买到，并且可以提供数倍于改变生活的洞察力。

The conflict between these two – most books don’t need to be read to the end, but some books can change your life – means you need two things to get a lot out of reading: **Lots of inputs and a strong filter**.  

这两者之间的冲突——大多数书不需要读到最后，但有些书可以改变你的生活——意味着你需要两件事才能从阅读中获得很多东西：大量的投入和强大的过滤器。

If you only pick up books you know with certainty you’re going to like you’ll confine yourself to reading the same authors on the same topics. It gives fresh oxygen to confirmation bias and limits your ability to connect the dots between different fields and different cultures. It’s better to have a low bar in what books you’re willing to try, and even the faintest tickle of interest should be enough to make the cut. Kindle samples are free, so excuses are minimal.  

如果你只拿起你肯定知道你会喜欢的书，你会限制自己阅读相同主题的相同作者。它为确认偏差提供了新鲜的氧气，并限制了您连接不同领域和不同文化之间点的能力。最好对你愿意尝试的书有一个较低的标准，即使是最微弱的兴趣也应该足以晋级。Kindle样品是免费的，所以借口很少。

Once you’ve flooded your desk with inputs, you have to bring out the filter.  

一旦你的桌子被输入淹没了，你必须拿出过滤器。

It should be ruthless, taking no prisoners and offering no mercy. Similar to dating, a book you’re not into after 10 minutes of attention has little chance of a happy ending. Slam it shut and move on. You’re not a failure if you quit a book after three pages anymore than if you reject the proposition of a 10-hour date with someone you just met who annoys you. Lots of fish in the sea.  

它应该是无情的，不俘虏，不怜悯。与约会类似，一本书在10分钟后你不感兴趣，几乎没有机会得到一个幸福的结局。关上门，继续前进。如果你在读完三页书后就放弃了一本书，你就不会失败，就像你拒绝与刚认识的惹恼你的人约会10个小时的提议一样。海里有很多鱼。

This applies to more than reading books. It’s true for all kinds of data, research, conversation, and learning. Without flooding your brain with inputs you’ll be stuck in the tiny world of what you’ve personally experienced. But without a strong filter you’ll be overwhelmed with choice and paralyzed by inaction.  

这不仅仅适用于阅读书籍。对于各种数据、研究、对话和学习都是如此。如果没有输入淹没你的大脑，你就会被困在你亲身经历的小世界中。但是，如果没有强大的过滤器，您将被选择所淹没，并因无所作为而瘫痪。

A good reading filter is more art than science. You’ll have to find one that works for you. The bigger point is that the highest odds of finding the right piece of information comes from inundating yourself with information but very quickly being able to say, “that ain’t it.”  

一个好的阅读过滤器与其说是科学，不如说是艺术。你必须找到一个适合你的。更重要的一点是，找到正确信息的最高几率来自自己被信息淹没，但很快就能够说，“不是这样。
